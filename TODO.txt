Look into making an instance copy method for classes.
This is especially useful when copying instances from a "gallery" of game 
objects.

Organize getters, setters, and predicates for classes like in mover.lisp.


Settle on a Lisp game library that isn't Linux specific and won't explode when a controller is polled. (SDL2 is a headache atm)
